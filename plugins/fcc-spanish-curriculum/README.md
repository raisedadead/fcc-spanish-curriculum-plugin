# freeCodeCamp Spanish Curriculum Plugin

A multi-agent pipeline for building the freeCodeCamp Professional Spanish course across CEFR levels A1–C2.

---

## What's inside

| Agent | Command | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Dra. Carmen Vidal** | `/carmen` | Researcher & planner — reads the Google Sheets planning spreadsheet, maps PCIC concepts, writes detailed task sequences with `—carmen` signature |
| **Marcos Ibáñez** | `/marcos` | Task creator — reads Carmen's plan from Google Sheets and writes `.md` task files directly into a cloned Git repo on a feature branch |
| **Curriculum** | `/curriculum` | Orchestrator — runs Carmen → Marcos in sequence with a review checkpoint in between |

Plus a **task validation hook** that automatically checks every `.md` file Marcos writes for structural correctness.

---

## Setup (first time only)

**→ See [`setup/credentials-setup.md`](setup/credentials-setup.md) for complete step-by-step instructions.**

High-level summary:

1. Admin creates a Google Cloud service account and shares the credentials JSON with the team
2. Each team member stores the JSON as the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable
3. Each team member clones the curriculum Git repo
4. Optionally: each team member adds their GitHub token to `.mcp.json` for PR creation

---

## Installation

Extract the plugin zip, then open the Claude desktop app:

- **Mac/Linux**: Settings → Plugins → Install from folder → select `fcc-spanish-curriculum/`
- **Windows**: Same path using the Windows folder picker

All three slash commands appear immediately after installation.

## Running the pipeline

Every session, you'll tell the agents two things:
- The Google Sheet URL (or name) for the planning spreadsheet
- The path to your cloned curriculum repo (for Marcos)

### Full pipeline
```
/curriculum — plan and create module 2 of "Describing a Company" chapter
```
Carmen plans → you review → Marcos creates task files on your current feature branch.

### Planning only
```
/carmen — plan module 2 of "Describing a Company and Its People" chapter
Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID/edit
```

### Task creation only (after Carmen has planned)
```
/marcos — create tasks for "Describing a Company" chapter, module 2
Repo: /Users/yourname/projects/fcc-spanish-curriculum-content
Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID/edit
```

---

## Branch protection

Marcos checks the current Git branch before writing any file. If you are on `main` or `master`, Marcos stops and asks you to create a feature branch first:

```
⛔ You are on the `main` branch. I can't write task files to `main`.
Please create a feature branch first, for example:
git checkout -b feat/describing-a-company-module-2
Then let me know when you're ready.
```

Create the branch yourself, then re-run Marcos. He will confirm the branch and proceed.

---

## Carmen's signature system

When Carmen adds content to the Google Sheet (only when explicitly directed), it marks its contributions with a `—carmen` signature so the team can distinguish Carmen's input from human-authored content.

When updating a cell that already has team-written content, Carmen appends a suggestion in *italic* + `—carmen` rather than overwriting:

> *Suggested task sequence: ...*
> *—carmen*

Carmen never writes to the sheet without being asked.

---

## Validation hook

After every `.md` file is written, the plugin automatically runs a structural check:

```
┌─ 📋 Task Validator: PRACTICE_task-2.md
│  ✅ All structure checks passed.
└──────────────────────────────────────────────
```

If something is wrong:
```
┌─ 📋 Task Validator: PRACTICE_task-3.md
│  ⚠️  MC task missing: ## --video-solution-- (correct answer index)
│
│  1 warning(s) — review before committing to GitHub.
└──────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Warnings only — the file is still created, but flagged for review.

---

## GitHub MCP (optional)

With the GitHub MCP configured (see `setup/credentials-setup.md`), Marcos can open draft PRs directly from a session after writing task files. Carmen can also check which modules are merged vs in review, tying back to the "PR Links/notes" column in the Chapter Status sheet.

---

## CEFR level coverage

Carmen works across all levels. When starting a new level, tell Carmen which level and provide the new sheet URL. Carmen automatically reads all prior-level sheets before planning to avoid concept repetition.

---

## Team roles

| Role | Primary agent | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| Curriculum Lead | `/carmen` | Plans modules, sets task sequences, updates the Google Sheet |
| Content Writer | `/marcos` | Creates task files from Carmen's plan on a feature branch |
| Reviewer | Both | Reviews task files before PR merge |
| Pipeline Owner | `/curriculum` | Runs the full Carmen → Marcos pipeline |

---

## Updating the plugin

Skill files live in `skills/carmen/SKILL.md`, `skills/marcos/SKILL.md`, and `skills/curriculum/SKILL.md`. Edit them to refine agent behavior, then repackage and redistribute the zip.
