# Planning Spreadsheet Schema Reference

Each CEFR level has its own spreadsheet. All follow the same structure.

Current files:
- **A1:** `CL-A1 Spanish Planning-updated.xlsx`
- Future levels will follow the same naming pattern (e.g., `CL-A2 Spanish Planning.xlsx`)

## Chapter Status Sheet — Source of Truth for What's Been Built

### Columns

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Due Date | Date or blank | When this item is due |
| Person/Status | Text | Name (in progress), `Merged 🎉` (complete), or a number (unassigned backlog) |
| Type | Text | `Chapter`, `Module`, `Learn`, `Warm-up`, `Practice`, `Review`, `Quiz` |
| Name | Human-readable title | |
| dashed-name | Text | URL slug — always `es-[level]-[type]-[kebab-case]` |
| QA | Boolean | True = passed quality review |
| PR Links/notes | Text | GitHub PR URL or notes |

### Status Interpretation

| Status value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Merged 🎉` | **Fully complete and live** — treat as TAUGHT |
| Person's name (e.g., "Rafael") | In progress — NOT yet taught |
| Number (e.g., 0, 1, 2) | Backlog / unassigned — NOT yet taught |
| Blank | Row is a Chapter header, not a task |

### Block Hierarchy

```
Chapter  (Type = "Chapter")
  └── Module  (Type = "Module")
        ├── Warm-up
        ├── Learn       (may repeat for multiple topics)
        ├── Practice
        ├── Review
        └── Quiz
```

## Grammar / Pronunciation / Ortography Sheets — PCIC Concept Inventory

These contain the raw PCIC reference material for the level. Header row structure:

```
Section | Subsection / Item | Topic | Example / Notes | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3
```

- **Section** — broad grammar/pronunciation/ortography category
- **Subsection / Item** — PCIC section number (e.g., `1.2. El género de los sustantivos`)
- **Topic** — the specific teachable concept
- **Example / Notes** — sample language or clarifying notes
- **Block 1–3** — which curriculum blocks cover this concept (often empty; don't rely on these alone)

## Chapter Content Sheets — Module Planning Detail

Each completed chapter has its own sheet named after it (e.g., `Greetings and Introductions`). These show the Plan curricular tables and block sequences for all modules in that chapter.

**When to read these:**
- During Research & Plan mode: to understand the depth and style of prior modules
- During Refine mode: as the primary object of review

| A2 | `a2` | `es-a2-learn-preterite-regular-verbs` |
