# Task Formats Reference

All task files are Markdown using `# --section--` headings. Every file starts
with an HTML comment documenting the audio line, then follows the template for
its block type and interaction format.

---

## Format Selection Guide

Choose the interaction format based on what best tests the concept:

| Concept type | Best format |
|---|---|
| Comprehension — did they understand what they heard? | Multiple Choice |
| Vocabulary — do they know a specific word or phrase? | Fill in the Blank |
| Grammar rule — true/false about a pattern they just learned | True or False |
| Numbers, names, factual recall | Multiple Choice or Fill in the Blank |
| Sentence structure — building from parts | Fill in the Blank |

Within each block type, the **purpose** of the description differs:
- **Warm-up**: Brief intro to prime the learner. No grammar explanations. Simple.
- **Learn**: Full teaching moment. Explain the rule, give examples in description.
- **Practice**: Confirmation task. No examples — learner applies knowledge alone.

---

## Block Type Differences at a Glance

| | Warm-up | Learn | Practice |
|---|---|---|---|
| Description style | Brief intro, no examples | Full explanation + examples | State concept being practiced, no examples |
| Question complexity | Simple | Moderate | Moderate to challenging |
| Explanation depth | Brief, flag gotchas | Reinforce teaching point | Reinforce + expand |
| Has `--video-solution--`? | Yes (MC/TF) | Yes (MC/TF) | Yes (MC/TF) |

---

## Correct Answer Rule

**The correct answer never has a `### --feedback--` block under it.**
Wrong answers always do.

Do **not** add any comment to the correct answer line. The absence of a `### --feedback--` block is the only signal needed.

---

## Formatting Rules

**No `→` arrows.** Use a dash `-` instead in all explanations and conjugation pairs.

- ✅ `desarrollar` - `desarrolla` (to develop - develops)
- ❌ `desarrollar` → `desarrolla`

**`For example:` spacing.** When introducing examples in a description or explanation:
- Always put a blank line before `For example:`
- If there is **only one example**, write it on the next line without a `-` bullet
- If there are **two or more examples**, use `-` bullets for each

Single example (no bullet):
```
...pattern used throughout this module.

For example:
`La empresa tiene veinticinco empleados.` — The company has twenty-five employees.
```

Multiple examples (bullets):
```
...structure used throughout this module:

For example:
- `La empresa tiene veinticinco empleados.` — The company has twenty-five employees.
- `El equipo tiene seis miembros.` — The team has six members.
```

## Spanish vs. English Backtick Rules

These rules apply everywhere: answer options, descriptions, explanations, and feedback.

**Rule 1 — All Spanish content gets backticks.**
Any Spanish word, phrase, fragment, or full sentence must be wrapped in backticks.
- ✅ `La empresa crea productos digitales.`
- ❌ La empresa crea productos digitales.

**Rule 2 — English content never gets backticks.**
Plain English prose, English answer options, and English labels stay outside backticks.
- ✅ A technology company.
- ❌ `A technology company.`

**Rule 3 — Spanish answer options: backticks + capitalize the first letter.**
When an answer option is in Spanish, wrap it in backticks AND capitalize the first letter.
- ✅ `El departamento de marketing`.
- ✅ `La empresa CREA productos digitales`
- ❌ `el departamento de marketing`

**Rule 4 — English answer options: plain text, no backticks.**
- ✅ Twelve employees.
- ✅ A technology company.
- ❌ `Twelve employees.`

**Rule 5 — Structure patterns: only backtick the Spanish fragments, not the placeholders.**
When showing a grammatical pattern in an explanation, backtick each Spanish segment
but leave English placeholder labels outside backticks.
- ✅ `El departamento de` [department's name] + `tiene` + [number] + `empleados`.
- ❌ `El departamento de` `[department's name]` + `tiene` + `[number]` + `empleados`.

---

## Conjugation Task Format (Multiple Choice)

When the concept being tested is a verb conjugation, use full sentences as answer
options — not isolated words. The verb being tested must appear in UPPERCASE within
the sentence so the learner can clearly see what is being evaluated.

**Question stem:**
> Which of the following sentences is conjugated correctly with the verb `[verb]`?

**Answer options — full sentences, verb in uppercase:**
```
`La empresa CREAR productos digitales`    ← wrong (infinitive)
`La empresa CREAN productos digitales`    ← wrong (3rd plural)
`La empresa CREO productos digitales`     ← wrong (1st singular)
`La empresa CREA productos digitales`     ← correct
```

All options are Spanish sentences in backticks with the first letter capitalized.
Wrong-answer feedback explains which person/number/form was wrong and why.
The explanation shows the full conjugation table and highlights the 3rd person form.

Warm-up and Practice.

## PRACTICE TASKS

guidance. The description confirms what concept is being practiced but gives
**no examples** — that would give away the answer.

### Practice: Multiple Choice

## REVIEW TASKS

Review tasks have **no audio comment** at the top. They are read-only reference
blocks — no questions, no blanks, no video solution. The learner confirms they
read it via `# --assignment--`.

### Review-Grammar (`REVIEW-GRAMMAR_task-1.md`)

The grammar review is a short article reinforcing key grammar points from the
module's Learn blocks. Group content under `## Heading` sections. Use `<br />`
between sections. All Spanish examples use backticks. All prose is in English.

```markdown
<!-- GRAMMAR -->

# --description--

Congratulations! You're almost done with this module.

The article below will help you review some key grammar points covered in the
tasks, so you can feel confident before taking the Module Quiz.

Once you've read it, just mark the task as complete and move on to the next
part of the review.

## [Grammar Point 1 — e.g. "Subject Pronoun Omission"]

### Review-Glossary (`REVIEW-GLOSSARY_task-1.md`)

The glossary lists all key vocabulary from the module, grouped by category and
in alphabetical order within each category. Use the `- \`Spanish\` – English`
format. Use `<br>` between categories. No audio comment.

```markdown
<!-- GLOSSARY -->

# --description--

This **Glossary** is a quick reference of the most important words and phrases
from the content you've worked with in this module.

The words are organized by category and in alphabetical order.

exactly **3 distractors** (wrong answers) and **1 answer** (correct answer).
Aim for 10 questions per module; 20 for larger modules. State the passing
threshold in the description.
